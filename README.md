Getting and cleaning data - course project

Initial settings:

Users will need to install the "dplyr" packages as this R script will make use of the dplyr library such as Contain, Select, Chain, etc. The script needs to be stored an located at the working directory. 

This script will download the zipped datasets to your working directory, and then unzip the data files for you. So, you do not need to download the data files in advance. 


Running the script code

After making sure the initial settings are done properly, to source the "run_analysis.R" script, you would need to type in the following at your R console:

source("run_analysis.R")

Output file

An output file called "tidydata.txt" will be automatically generated and saved to your working directory at the end of the script.
